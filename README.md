This project is an automated plant watering system built using the M5Core2 microcontroller and a suite of sensors, integrating IoT capabilities for real-time monitoring and control. The system measures environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and soil moisture while monitoring water levels using a Time-of-Flight sensor. By leveraging this data, it automates irrigation based on configurable thresholds or a predefined schedule.

A Telegram bot serves as the user interface, allowing for seamless remote interaction. Users can retrieve sensor data, adjust watering schedules, toggle between manual and automatic modes, and directly control the water pump. The system is designed to be both user-friendly and reliable, with features like real-time clock synchronization via NTP for precise scheduling and enterprise-grade WiFi connectivity for secure communication. This project demonstrates a practical application of IoT in smart agriculture, focusing on efficiency and ease of use.
